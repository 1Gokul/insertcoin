# insertcoin (ARCHIVED)

My first foray into web development!

Made to just implement basic **CRUD** operations in MongoDB, with a basic front-end. Not responsive on mobile, so I recommend using it on a desktop.

You can check out the website here: [insertcoin-store.herokuapp.com](https://insertcoin-store.herokuapp.com/)

### If you plan on working on the code...

- [Get a MongoDB connection string](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/cloud/connectionstring/)
- Clone the repo and navigate to its folder
- Create a virtual environment

    1. Install pip if you haven't: `sudo apt install -y python3-pip`
    2. Install Python 3's standard virtual environment library: `sudo apt install -y python3-venv`
    3. Create the virtual environment: `python3 -m venv <your_venv_name>`
- Activate the virtual environment: `source <your_venv_name>/bin/activate`
- Install the application's requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run main.py to begin.
